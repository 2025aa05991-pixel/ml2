Dataset Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
Source: Kaggle (UCI ML Repository)
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

WHY THIS DATASET SATISFIES ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS:

✅ Binary Classification:
   - Target variable: diagnosis
   - Classes: M (malignant), B (benign)
   - Clear medical diagnostic use case

✅ Instance Requirement (≥500):
   - Actual: 569 instances
   - Exceeds minimum by 69 samples
   - Sufficient for robust train-test split (80-20 = 455/114)

✅ Feature Requirement (≥12):
   - Actual: 30 real-valued numeric features
   - Exceeds minimum by 18 features
   - All features computed from cell nucleus images:
     * 10 mean values (radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.)
     * 10 standard errors
     * 10 worst/largest values

✅ Data Quality:

CLASS DISTRIBUTION:
- Malignant (M): 212 samples (37.3%) - positive class
- Benign (B): 357 samples (62.7%) - negative class
- Imbalance ratio: 0.255 → requires class_weight='balanced'

FEATURE GROUPS (30 total):
1. Mean measurements (10): radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, 
   area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean,

Purpose: Train all 6 models, compute metrics, save artifacts
Location: model/ directory

[SEE ACTUAL FILE: c:\workspace\BITS\Assignments\ML\ML2\model\train_all.py]

TRAINING PIPELINE STEPS:

1. Data Loading:
   - Load sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()
   - Convert to pandas DataFrame
   - Map target: 0=M (malignant), 1=B (benign)

2. Class Imbalance Check:
   - Calculate: |pos - neg| / total
   - If > 0.20 → apply class_weight='balanced'
   - Result: Yes (ratio = 0.255)

3. Train-Test Split:
   - 80% train (455 samples)
   - 20% test (114 samples)
   - Stratified split (maintains class ratio)
   - random_state=42

4. Model Creation (6 models):
   a. Logistic Regression: Pipeline(StandardScaler + LR)
   b. Decision Tree: class_weight='balanced'
   c. KNN: Pipeline(StandardScaler + KNN, k=5)

   f. XGBoost: scale_pos_weight calculated dynamically

5. Training Loop:
   - Fit each model on X_train, y_train
   - Predict on X_test
   - Compute 6 metrics per model
   - Save model to .pkl file

6. Metrics Computation (per model):
   - Accuracy: accuracy_score()

SECTION 4: CODE SNIPPETS (OPTIONAL)
---

Key Implementation Highlights:

4.1 Preprocessing Pipeline (from train_all.py):
```python
lr_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression(
        random_state=42,
        max_iter=10000,
        class_weight='balanced'
    ))
])
```

4.2 Metrics Computation (from train_all.py):
```python
metrics = {
    'Accuracy': accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred),
    'AUC': roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred_proba[:, 1]),
    'Precision': precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary', pos_label=0),
    'Recall': recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary', pos_label=0),
    'F1': f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary', pos_label=0),
    'MCC': matthews_corrcoef(y_true, y_pred)
}
```

4.3 Streamlit Model Loading (from app.py):
```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_model(model_name):
    model_file = MODELS_DIR / MODEL_FILES[model_name]
    if not model_file.exists():
        st.error(f"Model file not found: {model_file}")
        st.stop()
    return joblib.load(model_file)
```

---
SECTION 5: RESULTS ANALYSIS
---

Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 97.37%
- AUC: 0.9934
- F1 Score: 0.9535

Key Findings:
1. Logistic Regression outperforms complex models (RF, XGBoost) due to 
   linear separability of scaled features
2. StandardScaler crucial for LR and KNN performance
3. XGBoost achieves highest recall (95.35%), minimizing false negatives
4. Decision Tree has lowest AUC (0.9244) - prone to overfitting
5. All models achieve >92% accuracy, indicating dataset is well-suited 
   for ML classification

Medical Diagnosis Implications:
- High recall critical: Missing malignant tumor (false negative) is worse 
  than false alarm (false positive)
- XGBoost or LR recommended for production deployment
- Ensemble averaging could further improve robustness

================================================================================
8. DEPLOYMENT ERROR PREVENTION GUIDE
================================================================================

TOP 10 CAUSES OF STREAMLIT DEPLOYMENT FAILURES (AND FIXES):

1. MISSING DEPENDENCIES IN REQUIREMENTS.TXT
   Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'"
   Fix: Ensure ALL imports listed in requirements.txt with exact versions
   Verify: pip freeze > requirements.txt

2. MODEL FILES NOT COMMITTED TO REPO
   Error: "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'model/saved_models/...'"
   Fix: Train models locally, then git add + commit ALL .pkl files
   Verify: Run git ls-files | grep .pkl

3. INCORRECT FILE PATHS
   Error: "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory"
   Fix: Use Path(__file__).parent for relative paths
   Avoid: Hardcoded absolute paths like 'C:\\Users\\...'

4. PYTHON VERSION MISMATCH
   Error: "ERROR: This version requires Python 3.9+"
   Fix: Add runtime.txt with: python-3.11
   Streamlit Cloud supports: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

5. LARGE FILE SIZE (>100 MB)
   Error: "File too large to upload"
   Fix: Use Git LFS for large model files, or retrain with compression
   Check: du -sh model/saved_models/*

6. SYNTAX ERRORS IN PYTHON CODE
   Error: "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"
   Fix: Test locally first, check Python version compatibility
   Verify: python -m py_compile app.py

7. STREAMLIT SPECIFIC IMPORTS MISSING
   Error: "AttributeError: module 'streamlit' has no attribute 'cache_data'"
   Fix: Update streamlit version in requirements.txt
   Use: @st.cache_data for Streamlit ≥1.18

8. ENCODING ISSUES WITH CSV FILES
   Error: "UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte"
   Fix: Save CSVs with UTF-8 encoding: df.to_csv(..., encoding='utf-8')

9. MISSING MAIN GUARD
   Error: Code runs during import, causing infinite recursion
   Fix: Always use: if __name__ == "__main__": main()

10. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE CONFLICTS
    Error: "KeyError: 'HOME'"
    Fix: Don't rely on system environment variables
    Use: st.secrets for API keys and configs

TESTING CHECKLIST BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:

Local Environment Test:
1. Create fresh virtual environment
2. Install from requirements.txt only
3. Run training script
4. Run Streamlit app
5. Test all features
6. Check browser console for errors

Pre-Deployment Test:
1. Delete __pycache__ directories
2. Clear Streamlit cache: rm -rf ~/.streamlit/cache
3. Restart app with clean state
4. Upload sample CSV and verify predictions
5. Check all navigation paths

Post-Deployment Test:
1. Wait for full deployment (check logs)
2. Open app in incognito browser
3. Test from mobile device
4. Verify all downloads work
5. Check model loading times

DEBUGGING DEPLOYED APP:
- Check Streamlit Cloud logs: App Settings → Logs
- Look for Traceback errors
- Verify all file paths resolve correctly
- Test individual components in isolation

EMERGENCY FIXES:
If app crashes after deployment:
1. Check deployment logs immediately
2. Fix error in local environment first
3. Commit and push fix
4. Streamlit auto-redeploys on git push
5. Monitor logs until "App is live" message

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Use @st.cache_data for data loading
- Use @st.cache_resource for model loading
- Compress large files with joblib.dump(..., compress=3)
- Limit DataFrame display rows: st.dataframe(df.head(100))
